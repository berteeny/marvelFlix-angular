# MarvelFlix Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

The API used was created by myself in another project: it is hosted on Render [here](https://movie-api-v2dh.onrender.com/documentation.html) and the repository for that project can be found [here](https://github.com/berteeny/Movie_API) (Note * the API takes an extra few moments to load on first startup, as it is hosted using Render's free version).

## Docs
Documentation for all classes and methods used can be found in the `docs/` folder.  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
